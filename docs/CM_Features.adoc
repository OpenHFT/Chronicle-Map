Chronicle Map is an in-memory, key-value store, designed for low-latency, and/or multi-process
applications, such as trading and financial market applications.

== Features
 - **Ultra low latency**: Chronicle Map targets median latency of both read and write queries of less
 than 1 microsecond in https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map/search?l=java&q=perf&type=Code[certain tests].

 - **High concurrency**: Write queries scale well up to the number of hardware execution threads in
 the server. Read queries never block each other.
 - **Persistence to disk** - (Optional)
 - **Replication** - (Optional, commercial functionality) - replication from one to N other servers across LAN/WAN

== Unique features
 - Multiple processes can access a Chronicle Map concurrently. At the same time,
 the data store is *in-process* for each of the accessing processes. Out-of-process approach to IPC
 is simply incompatible with Chronicle Map's median latency target of < 1 Î¼s.

 - Replication

NOTE: See <<CM_Replication.adoc#,Chronicle Map Replication>> for more information.

**Chronicle Map** has two meanings:

- https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map/blob/master/spec[language-agnostic data store (specification)].

- https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map/blob/master/src[implementation of this data store for the JVM (source)]. Currently, this is the only implementation.

=== From the Java perspective
`ChronicleMap` is a `ConcurrentMap` implementation which stores the
entries *off-heap*, serializing/deserializing key and value objects to/from off-heap memory
transparently. Chronicle Map supports:

 - Key and value objects caching/reusing for making *zero allocations (garbage) on
queries*.
 - Flyweight values for eliminating serialization/deserialization cost and allowing direct
 read/write access to off-heap memory.

=== Primary Chronicle Map use cases

 - Replacing slower key-value stores, like `Redis` and `Memcached`, when used within a single server.

 - Replacing similar JVM-centric solutions, like `Coherence` and `Hazelcast`, for speed and/or certain Chronicle Map features which those solutions lack.

 - Moving parts of the application-state out of the Java heap for either:
 * Reducing the heap size, for reducing garbage collection pressure, or fitting 32 GB, for using `CompressedOops`.
 * Inter-process communication.
 * Persistence.
 * Replication across servers.

 - Drop-in `ConcurrentHashMap` replacement; Chronicle Map performs better in some cases.

=== What guarantees does Chronicle Map provide in ACID terms?

 - **Atomicity** - single-key queries are atomic if Chronicle Map is properly configured, multi-key
 queries are not atomic.
 - **Consistency** - doesn't make sense for key-value stores
 - **Isolation** - yes; for both single- and multi-key queries.
 - **Durability** - no; Chronicle Map can be persisted to disk, but with no guarantee as to how frequently this
 happens. This is under the control of the OS. All data is guaranteed to be written to disk when the Map is closed.
 - **Clustering** and **replication** for Chronicle
 Map is provided by https://chronicle.software/queue-enterprise/[Chronicle Queue Enterprise].

== What is the data structure of Chronicle Map?
Simply put, a Chronicle Map data store is a big chunk of shared memory (optionally mapped to disk).

It is split into independent segments; each segment has:

 - an independent memory allocation for storing the entries

 - a hash table for search

 - a lock in shared memory (implemented via CAS loops) for managing concurrent access.

See https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map/blob/master/spec[Chronicle Map data store design overview] for more information.

== Chronicle Map is not

 - A document store. There are no secondary indexes.
 - A https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimap[multimap].
 Using a Chronicle Map collection as a multimap is technically possible, but often leads to problems. See http://stackoverflow.com/a/36486525/648955[StackOverflow answer] for details.
 Developing a proper multimap, using
 Chronicle Map's design principles is possible.

 you would consider sponsoring such development.

== Chronicle Map does not support:

 - range queries.
 - iteration over the entries in alphabetical order.
 - sorting of keys.
 - LRU entry eviction.
